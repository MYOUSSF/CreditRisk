# Credit Risk Modeling Project

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks focused on credit risk modeling, covering Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD).

## Notebooks

### 1. [PD_Model](Probability_of_Default_Modelling.ipynb)
This notebook covers the data preparation process for modeling the Probability of Default (PD). The key steps include:

- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building a predictive model for PD
- Assessing model performance and dealing with unbalanced data
- Interpreting feature importance.

### 2. [LGD Model](Loss_Given_Default_Modelling.ipynb)
This notebook focuses on the modeling of Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD). The steps include:

- Data preprocessing for LGD & EAD
- Building and evaluating models to estimate LGD and EAD
- Evaluating model performance with different metrics
- Interpreting the significance of the features.
